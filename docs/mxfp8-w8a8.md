# MXFP8 (W8A8) MoE experts

Native MXFP8 routed-expert serving for SM120/SM121: E4M3 weight codes with
UE8M0 group-of-32 block scales, against activations quantized at runtime to
E4M3 with UE8M0 group-of-32 block scales. Both operands are real FP8, so the
contraction runs on the block-scaled `mxf8f6f4` `m16n8k32` MMA emitted by
`cute.nvgpu.warp.MmaMXF8Op` — the same instruction family the MX-FP6 path
drives, but with no 3:4-packed operand and no in-shared-memory expansion.

This is the MoE counterpart of the dense MXFP8 paths
(`gemm/mxfp8_linear`, `gemm/blockscaled` MXFP8 packing). The FP6 recipe is
documented in `docs/mxfp6-w6a8.md`.

## Format

- **Weights on disk**: MXFP8 E4M3 codes, `uint8` or `float8_e4m3fn`, one code
  per element: `[E, 2*I, K]` for the gated FC1 and `[E, K, I]` for FC2. The
  bytes remain E4M3 throughout preparation and execution. Gate-first FC1
  projections are reordered without requantization.
- **Block scales on disk**: UE8M0, `uint8` or `float8_e8m0fnu`,
  `[E, rows, K/32]` (FC1) and `[E, K, I/32]` (FC2), **unswizzled**. Preparation
  validates them and swizzles them into the MMA layout with
  `b12x._lib.intrinsics.swizzle_block_scale` — the one canonical scale
  swizzle in the tree, shared with the MX-FP6 recipe.
- **Invalid scales are rejected, never clamped**: `0xFF` is UE8M0 NaN. Any
  block scale byte equal to `0xFF` raises during preparation; the finite range
  `0x00..0xFE` is preserved bit-for-bit.
- **Per-expert globals**: the checkpoint's `*_weight_scale_2` combine with the
  reciprocal activation global scales into runtime alphas,
  `alpha = weight_scale_2 / a_gscale`, exactly as the other MX recipes do. A
  non-finite alpha (a zero `a_gscale`) is a preparation error.
- **Activations**: quantized inside the fused kernel at both GEMM boundaries —
  the routed input row before FC1 and the SwiGLU intermediate before FC2 — to
  E4M3 with a UE8M0 K/32 scale that is the exact-IEEE-bit power-of-two ceiling
  of `amax * global_scale / 448` (`fp6_block_ue8m0_exact`, not
  `ceil(log2(...))`), with the calibrated per-expert global scale folded in at
  quantize time.
- **Geometry**: `hidden_size % 128 == 0` and `intermediate_size % 128 == 0`,
  SiLU only, `sf_vec_size == 32`, and the production `(128, 128)` MMA tile.
  Both GEMM K extents are streamed as 128-element tiles of one byte per
  element, so a K-tile is 128 bytes on both operand sides.

## MoE (`moe.fused_moe`, quant mode `w8a8_mx`)

`quant_mode="w8a8_mx"` with `source_format="mxfp8_e8m0_k32"`, reached through
the canonical planned lifecycle:

Call `plan_weights` with `PackedSourceFormat.MXFP8_E8M0_K32`, the checkpoint's
`W13Layout`, `ActivationMode.A8`, SiLU, BF16 I/O and `MoEGeometry`.
Pass the serialized payloads and unswizzled scales as `PackedWeights` to
`prepare_weights`. Declare `plan_execution` with `ExecutionCapacity` for the
largest serving batch and top-k. Prepare every declaration in a
`PreparationSession` before binding caller inputs, routes and output storage.
Run the binding with `fused_moe.run`. CUDA graph capture uses that same prepared
binding under frozen kernel resolution.

`prepare_weights` returns `PreparedExperts` whose representation value is
`b12x.moe._shared.kernels.w8a8.PreparedW8A8MXFP8Weights`:
`w13_values`/`w2_values` (byte-exact `[E, N, K]` uint8),
`w13_sf_swizzled`/`w2_sf_swizzled` (`[E, pad128(N), pad4(K/32)]` uint8), and
`w13_alpha`/`w2_alpha` (`[E]` f32), with `w13`/`w2`/`w13_scale`/`w2_scale`/
`w13_global_scale`/`w2_global_scale` aliases for the generic owner plumbing.
Callers hand **unswizzled** scale grids; B12X swizzles them.

A gate-first (`w31`) FC1 is rotated to the kernel-native `[up; gate]` order
during preparation, while the payload and its scale grid are both still
unswizzled, so the row flip and the MMA swizzle cannot disagree about which
row is which.

Everything else is the existing unified dynamic kernel: route/pack, the
materialized persistent work queue, SwiGLU, the atomic scatter (or the
deterministic route-buffer top-k sum), and the per-expert alpha plumbing are
unchanged from `w6a8_mx`. The recipe differences are confined to operand
transport:

| | `w6a8_mx` | `w8a8_mx` |
|---|---|---|
| B gmem K extent | `3K/4` packed bytes | `K` bytes |
| B smem staging | packed TMA tile aliased into sB, expanded in place | direct TMA into the swizzled sB |
| MMA emission | inline `mxf8f6f4` asm, `e4m3 × e2m3` | `MmaMXF8Op`, `e4m3 × e4m3` |
| weight bytes vs checkpoint | 3:4-packed, source-native | identical |

Scheduling is the unified dynamic backend; `dynamic` is the only legal backend
and `(128, 128)` the only legal tile, both enforced during tuning-contract
validation rather than discovered at launch.

## Shared byte-container geometry

`MoEDynamicKernelBackend` splits the FP6-specific concerns from the genuinely
shared ones so the two recipes cannot drift:

- `is_w6a8` — 3:4-packed B staging, the in-place expansion, and the inline FP6
  MMA dispatch;
- `is_w8a8` — the new recipe;
- `is_mxf8` (`is_w6a8 or is_w8a8`) — `tile_k = sf_vec_size * 4`, the
  `MmaMXF8Op` tiled MMA and its SF atom geometry, the one-byte-per-element
  activation scratch, and the FC2-intermediate container requant.

## Tests

- `tests/moe/test_mxfp8_w8a8.py` — CPU: the planner/lowering vocabulary, the
  lossless weight contract checked byte-for-byte against the canonical scale
  layout, UE8M0 `0xFF` rejection, alpha math,
  malformed-input rejection, and a check that the oracle quantizer reproduces
  the device PTX scale-byte rule at power-of-two boundaries. GPU: numerical
  execution against `moe_reference_w8a8_mx` on the model geometry
  (K=2560, I=640, top-k=10) with 1/5/16 tokens, experts with no routes, and
  CUDA-graph replay under frozen kernel resolution.
- `tests/moe/test_moe_execution_model.py` — the recipe-independent lowering
  invariants.

## Verified Execution

The reduced expert-count lane uses E=16, K=2560, I=640 and top-k=10 on
RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Max-Q (SM120). The full native suite passes 21 tests.
It covers numerical output at M=1/5/16, empty experts, atomic graph replay
against the quantized reference and deterministic bit-exact graph replay.
Compute Sanitizer memcheck passes all six execution/replay cases with zero
reported errors. The retained NVFP4 preparation/decode/replay lane passes
three tests with the same 42,538,496-byte peak allocation as before the change.

The emitted device objects record `-arch sm_120f`. Their disassembly contains
`QMMA.SF.16832.F32.E4M3.E4M3.E8`. This proves native block-scaled MXFP8
execution on SM120 and compilation for the SM120/SM121 family. It does not
prove SM121 execution.

The host-directory program cache survives consumer-container removal. A fresh
container runs the full native suite with 13 disk-cache hits and zero compile
misses. Its bytes live on the host filesystem, not in the container. Removing
the cache directory or losing that filesystem destroys them.

Full step5500 MTP boot, acceptance rate and comparison with Marlin remain
unmeasured. The available GPU runs a live engine that must stay untouched.
The native recipe is not a serving-throughput improvement claim.
